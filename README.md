❓ Why This Project?
In today's digital era, secure and efficient access to information is crucial. This project aims to provide a fast, reliable, and secure way for users to manage their notes while ensuring data protection through authentication. Inspired by real-world needs, this project allowed me to apply practical skills in React, JavaScript, and RESTful API integration. Developing this note-taking app deepened my understanding of React’s component-based architecture, state management, and secure authentication systems, making it a significant step in my learning journey. 

📄 Note: This project is based on an final submission from the course "Belajar Fundamental Aplikasi Web dengan React" on Dicoding Indonesia. The goal was to implement and expand on the core concepts introduced in the course.
